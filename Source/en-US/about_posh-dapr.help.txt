SHORT DESCRIPTION
   posh-dapr provides tab completion that goes beyond that supported by the
   `dapr completion` command that comes with Dapr.

LONG DESCRIPTION
   posh-dapr lets you tab complete sub commands, flags and instance names. It
   also supports filtered completion. For example, with posh-dapr, PowerShell
   can tab complete dapr commands like `stop` by type `dapr st` and pressing
   the tab key twice. If you continue to press tab you will cycle between the
   `status` and `stop` commands.

   posh-dapr can complete instance names for the `stop` command. For example,
   you can type `dapr stop` and pressing the tab to cycle through all the
   running instances of dapr.
